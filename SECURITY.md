# 🛡️ XfeaturesGroup Security Doctrine

> **Security is not a passive state. It is an active protocol.** > *At XfeaturesGroup, we operate under a strict dual-tier security philosophy: **XfeaturesGUARD** for impenetrable perimeter defense, and **ZERO** for proactive threat neutralization.*

This document outlines our security policies, supported software lifecycles, and the mandatory protocol for reporting vulnerabilities across the entire XfeaturesGroup ecosystem.

## ⚠️ Reporting a Vulnerability

**DO NOT** create a public GitHub Issue for security vulnerabilities. Public disclosure before a patch is deployed is considered a hostile act against the XfeaturesGroup ecosystem.

We take infrastructure integrity seriously and appreciate the efforts of responsible security researchers. If you have discovered a vulnerability:

1. **Document the Vector:** Provide a detailed summary of the vulnerability, including steps to reproduce, potential impact, and the specific subsystem affected.
2. **Secure Transmission:** Send your comprehensive report directly to our security division at:
   👉 **security@xfeatures.net** 3. **Standby for Protocol:** Our automated triage systems and security engineers will acknowledge receipt within 24 hours. 

*Valid, reproducible reports that help secure our perimeter are eligible for entry into the XfeaturesGroup Bug Bounty program.*

## 🛑 The ZERO Protocol (Active Response)

XfeaturesGroup does not merely block threats; we track and neutralize their sources. 

While we welcome ethical hacking and responsible disclosure, unauthorized malicious probing, DDoS attempts, or aggressive exploitation outside of our stated disclosure guidelines will trigger **Protocol ZERO**. 

* **Reverse Engineering:** We will analyze your attack vectors.
* **Source Identification:** We will trace the origin.
* **Active Neutralization:** We will take necessary measures to suppress the threat at its source to protect our network and our clients' assets.

**By interacting with XfeaturesGroup infrastructure, you acknowledge these terms.**
